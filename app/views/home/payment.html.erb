<h1>Payment </h1>
<br/>
<br/>
On this page we will handle payment for renting a bike. As part of our minimum viable product,
instead of handle genuine USD transactions, we plan to institute a points system. We will offer 
each user 150 points, and "charge" them a certain number of points (e.g., 10 points) per ride, and
another set number of points to "purchase" a membership. We will put this feature in place once
we are able to link it with users, accounts, bikes and stations, as each payment must be linked
to each of these objects.
